# Data Management Plans (DMP), an Introduction

- Pre-workshop activities: 15 min 
- Presentation: 39 min

## Why Data Management Plans (DMP)? 

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal and evolving document that outlines the practices, processes, and strategies of the data you expect to acquire or generate during the course of a research project.

By completing a DMP you will be working towards:

- Setting out consistent strategies for how your data will be managed
- Identifying strengths and weaknesses in your current practices 
- Preparing the data for future reuse, preservation, and sharing
- Reducing the overall cost of research by increasing project efficiencies

This workshop uses the [DMP Assistant](https://assistant.portagenetwork.ca/){:target="_blank"} because it is a national, online, bilingual data management planning tool developed by the [Portage Network](https://portagenetwork.ca/){:target="_blank"} in collaboration with host institution University of Alberta to assist researchers in preparing DMPs. This tool is freely available to all researchers, and develops a DMP through a series of key data management questions, supported by best-practice guidance and examples.

DMPs are one of the foundations of good research data management (RDM), an international best practice, and increasingly required by institutions and funders. For example, they are a pillar of the Canadian [Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy](https://science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_97610.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Understand the importance of good research data management
2. Be familiar with the DMP Assistant
3. Be familiar with key data management planning considerations

# Data Management Plans (DMPs), an Introduction

- Pre-workshop activities: 15 min 
- Workshop Video: 39 min

## Why Data Management Plans (DMPs)? 

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is an evolving document that outlines the practices, processes, and strategies of the data you expect to acquire or generate during the course of a research project.

**By completing a DMP you will be working towards:**

- Setting out consistent strategies for how your data will be managed
- Identifying strengths and weaknesses in your current practices 
- Preparing the data for future reuse, preservation, and sharing
- Reducing the overall cost of research by increasing project efficiencies

This workshop recommends the use of the [DMP Assistant](https://assistant.portagenetwork.ca/){:target="_blank"} to create a DMP. The DMP Assistant is a national, online, bilingual data management planning tool developed by the [Portage Network](https://portagenetwork.ca/){:target="_blank"} in collaboration with host institution University of Alberta to assist researchers in preparing DMPs. This tool is freely available to all researchers, and develops a DMP through a series of key data management questions, supported by best-practice guidance and examples.

DMPs are one of the foundations of good research data management, international best practice, and required by institutions and granting agencies. They are a pillar of the Canadian [Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy](https://science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_97610.html){:target="_blank"}, and for certain funding opportunities **DMPs will be required** to be submitted at the time of application.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Understand the importance of good research data management
2. Be familiar with the DMP Assistant
3. Be familiar with key data management planning considerations
